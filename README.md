## Introduction

This project is part of the [Python Project for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-science) offered by IBM on the Coursera platform. The course is powered by IBM, and we would like to express our gratitude to the [Foundation for Excellence](ffe.org) for providing this educational opportunity.

As a participant in this project, you will play the role of a Data Scientist/Data Analyst working for a startup investment firm. The objective is to extract financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping for popular stocks like Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. Once the data is collected, you will create a dashboard to visualize key performance indicators, identifying patterns and trends.
